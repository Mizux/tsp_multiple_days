# TSP over multiple days

This repo is what I did to solve a question asked on the OR Tools forum about how to
[convert a single-day TSP problem into a multi-day TSP
problem](https://groups.google.com/g/or-tools-discuss/c/VP_Gb1tC_BM).
The original code was by @joshykautz.  My additions and edits are in
the commit log here.

To run it, you have to have python 3 installed, with OR Tools.

Then just run

```
python tsp_multiple_days.py
```
